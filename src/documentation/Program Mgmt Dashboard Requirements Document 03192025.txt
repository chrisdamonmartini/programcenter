Program Management Dashboard Requirements Document
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a Program Management Dashboard to be used in the management of a military defense program. The dashboard will provide a comprehensive view of program status, financials, scheduling, risk management, compliance, engineering performance, supply chain logistics, and stakeholder engagement.

* Display a risk matrix (Likelihood vs. Impact).
* List top program risks with mitigation plans.
* Track issues and resolutions.
2.6 Compliance & Regulatory Oversight
* Indicate contract compliance status.
* Show security classification levels.
* Track ITAR/EAR export control considerations.
* Monitor cybersecurity (CMMC compliance, NIST 800-171 adherence).
* Maintain audit and certification status.
2.7 Engineering & Technical Performance
* Display system requirements compliance status.
* Track Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) and Key System Attributes (KSAs).
* Show Technical Readiness Level (TRL) and Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL).
* Maintain a defect tracking and resolution system.
* 3D model-based visualization of engineering performance and system validation results.
2.8 Supply Chain & Logistics
* Monitor supplier performance and lead times.
* Track parts and material availability.
* Display production readiness.
* Provide sustainment and lifecycle support status.
* 3D supply chain visualization to track component flow and logistics bottlenecks.
2.9 Stakeholder Engagement & Reporting
* Track program reviews and meetings.
* Maintain action item logs and decision history.
* Provide customer feedback tracking.
* Display contract deliverable status.
* 3D dashboard components for executive-level visual reports of program progress.
2.10 Personnel & Resource Management
* Show key personnel assignments and availability.
* Track resource allocation (personnel vs. workload).
* Maintain training and certification requirements.
* Monitor security clearance levels.
2.11 Digital Integration & System Architecture
* Integrate with enterprise PLM, ERP, and scheduling tools.
* Implement role-based access control.
* Enable predictive analytics (AI-based forecasting for cost and schedule).
* Support interoperability with DoD systems.
* Provide mobile and web access.
* Leverage Teamcenter's IPP&E capabilities to ensure program alignment across engineering, supply chain, and operations.
* Integrate with OpenPlan for in-depth project scheduling, resource planning, and execution tracking.
* Support integration of 3D visualization engines (e.g., Siemens Teamcenter Visualization, WebGL-based viewers) for interactive reporting.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Security
* Implement multi-factor authentication.
* Ensure compliance with DoD cybersecurity standards.
* Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
3.2 Performance
* Support real-time data updates.
* Ensure system uptime of 99.9%.
3.3 Usability
* Design an intuitive UI with customizable dashboards.
* Provide role-based views and reports.
* Ensure seamless 3D report rendering with efficient performance.
4. Implementation Considerations
4.1 Technology Stack
* Web-based framework (React, Angular, or equivalent).
* Backend with RESTful APIs (Node.js, Python, or Java).
* Database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or NoSQL alternatives).
* Cloud or on-premise deployment options.
* Integrate with Teamcenter REST APIs, SOA, or ITK for seamless data access.
* Integrate with OpenPlan APIs for scheduling synchronization.
* Leverage WebGL-based 3D visualization for reports.
4.2 Deployment Plan
* Develop in Agile sprints with periodic reviews.
* Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT).
* Implement phased rollout to ensure adoption.
5. Conclusion
This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for a Program Management Dashboard for military defense programs. The implementation should ensure compliance, data security, and seamless integration with existing systems, particularly leveraging Teamcenter Integrated Program Planning and Execution (IPP&E) for managing work packages, dependencies, and deliverables within a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Organizational Breakdown Structure (OBS). Additionally, integration with OpenPlan will enable advanced scheduling, resource allocation, and scenario-based planning to enhance project execution efficiency.
The dashboard will also incorporate 3D visual reports to enhance program tracking, engineering validation, supply chain monitoring, and executive decision-making.
